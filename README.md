# twitch-stream
 It is simple JS project that uses `TWICTH API URL` to get the response back based on `query search` passed to the API URL. 
 This project uses `JSONP` to call Twitch API.
 Once project is downloaded; user can open `seach.html` file in browser by rightClik on file.
 Initial loaded page will not have any Results shown until valid query param is entered and search button is clicked.
 On successful Call user will see the infomartion of the user along with `Total_Results`; `Display_Picture`; `Game_Name`; `Total_Viewers`; `Description` (Note: If Response does not contain Description then status information is displayed.).
 This project uses some random `clinet_id` taken from the Twitch API doc's.
 user can pass some queries like `star`; `starwar`; `starcraft` etc.
